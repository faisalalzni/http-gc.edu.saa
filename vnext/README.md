# ReactNative for Windows (vnext)
![Hero Image with Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/master/.github/hero2.png)

See the official [React Native website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for an introduction to React Native. See [main landing page](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows) for more details on overall direction of `react-native-windows`. 

The [`current`](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/tree/master/current) subdirectory adds support for an earlier `react-native-windows` implementation built in C#. It reimplemented the JS<->Native bridge in C#, and shared the JS with Facebook's implementation of `react-native`. The ongoing direction of `react-native` involves a closer interaction between C++ and JS which is hard to achieve with a separate C# implementation.

In this `vnext` sub-folder, we are working on a rewrite of `react-native-windows` built in C++ that reuses the C++ core bridge implementation from Facebook’s React Native. This will allow React Native for Windows to innovate and provide features by sharing the same core as Facebook’s React Native. See [Status](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows#status) for more details.

## Status and roadmap
The development of the React Native Windows `vnext` implementation is ongoing. You can take a look at [Milestones](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/milestones) and [Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/projects) for a view on the work streams and tasks. 

The `vnext` package currently supports `v0.58` of corresponding `react-native` major version. See [releases](./docs/releases.md) for more information on `vnext` release strategy.

## Documentation
[React Native already has great documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html), and we're working to ensure the React Native Windows is part of that documentation story. Check out the [React documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react/) for further details about the React API in general.

For a live document for information on parity status with Android and iOS, including details on implemented and missing components and modules, along with related issues for missing features from partial implementations, see [Parity Status](./docs/ParityStatus.md).

Coming soon - we will be publishing more documentation including some of the following shortly:
- Guides on how to extend native Windows capabilties in C# and C++ using `vnext` 

## Getting Started
See [Getting Started Guide for React Native Windows C++](./docs/GettingStarted.md).

## Opening issues
If you encounter a bug with the React Native Windows C++ implementation or have a feature request, we would like to hear about it. Search the [existing issues](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Avnext) and try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist before opening a new issue. It’s helpful if you include the version of Windows, React Native, React Native Windows plugin, and device family (i.e., desktop, Xbox, etc.) you’re using. Please include a stack trace and reduced repro case when appropriate, too.

Please make sure to use the [correct template](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new?labels=vnext&template=vnext.md) for issues related to the vnext `react-native-windows` implementation.
